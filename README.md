# Volley Gear

Based on my parody game, "Pong Gear", I created for the last week of CodePen's weekly game challenge in April 2018. This version will use socket.io to connect two players in a game.

Version 2.0 will be much more performative, simulating the game entirely client-side with minimal interaction on the server.
